# Welcome to the Would Your Rather App!

This is a React/Redux project created to test my learnings during React Nanodegree program on Udacity.com.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
This will install all dependecy packages

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Testing the App

Use any of those usernames:
- sarahedo
- tylermcginnis
- johndoe

All users has the same password: 1234

## Observations

Changes and new records will not be accessible at their url because of the way the backend is set up in this application.
This app uses a static javascript data to simulate a database.
